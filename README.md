# RemoteModal

RemoteModal is a small gem built to drastically simplify rendering rails partials in `foundation` reveals via a remote Ajax call.

## Installation

Ensure Foundation is fully supported within your application. See [Foundation Rails](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-rails) for more details on setting up and installing foundation inside a Rails application.

Then Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'remote_modal'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install remote_modal

## Usage

RemoteModal uses a new helper method `remote_modal` to render any partial within your application into a Foundation Reveal Modal using a remote call to a controller `remote_modals_controller` created by this gem.

1. Create a new partial `static_modals/_my_test_modal.html.erb`
2. Create a link to open the reveal with `remote_modal('Click Me!', :my_test_modal)`
  * by default, RemoteModal looks for modals inside of a `static_modals` folder, if you pass a partial to the `remote_modal` method that doesn't exist in the normal context RemoteModal will look in the `static_modals` folder.
  * `remote_modal` accepts any partial path even ones with `/` in them. e.g. `remote_modal('Click Me!', 'static_modals/my_test_modal')`
3. Click the link and see your partial get appended to your document and opened with `.foundation('open')`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
